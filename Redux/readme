/* What is redux

-redux is not tied with react but is a js library
-redux is a state container/management
    state of an app is the state shared by all the individual components of that app
    eg loginFormComponent
        state = {
            username = '',
            paswword = '',
            ...
        }
-redux will store and manage the application state
-redux is predictable

-----wy redux is bad-----
-config redux is an app seems complicated
-redux requires alot of other packages to be installed to get redux to be effective
-redux requires too much boilerplate code

Why redux toolkit 

-serves as an abtraction over redux. it hides the difficult parts.

what to consider when to use redux

-large amounts of application state are needed in many places in the app
-the app state is updated frequently over time
-the logic to update the state may be complex 
-the has a medium or large sized codebase

----Three core concepts-----

-store (safely holds the state of an apoplication)
-action (describes what happened in the application)
-reducer (handles the action and decides how to update the state)

----Three principles----

-global state of your application is stored as an object inside a single store
-only way to change state is to dispatch an action, object that describes what happened
-specify hot state tree is updated based on actions, you write pure reducers

----Redux Store responsibilities----

-Holds application state
-allows access to state via getState()
-allows state to be updated via dispatch(action)
-registers listeners via subscribe(listener)
-handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscibe(listener)

library to help when working with redux
So keeping track that we updating the correct object we use a library called immer 
npm i immer

----Middleware----

-extends redux with custom functionality
-provides a third party extension point between dispatching an action and the  moment it reaches the reducer
-we can use it for eg. logging, crash reporting, performing asynchronous tasks etc

another library but for redux tool that u have in browser, this one is for terminal
npm i redux-logger
